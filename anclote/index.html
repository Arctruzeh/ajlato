It carves out a nice deep hard flowing pass and it has hard sand bottom with a little rock pan. It's great for migrating fish every season of year and it's chock full of bait and anglers focus on this year-round."

This will have limiting appeal for a group of game fish that are looking for current to bring them feeding opportunities, but it still may provide an ambush chance for a single game fish or a lesser gamefish in physical size."

These deeper narrower flows are great ambush zones and are good plays, especially on tide changes. This type of structure is perfect for drawing in flounder, snook and speckled trout."

Often this type of structure is good on higher tide phases or a single gamefish will hunt for pulled up finger mullet or maybe just bask in the sun's warmth on a cold morning"

It's just an expansive static structure and it's home to lots of bottom dwelling crustaceans and vertebraes that redfish thrive on. It's really not cover because most prey can't hide there because they got to dig a hole."

                    description: "now closely look at the upper left of this map where I labeled an area of structure called a trough it's uniquely different than a gut because it's not a pathway from the outside edge of the flat to the shallow Zone instead it acts as a giant elongated pothole that both Bait fish and gamefish fall into on Lower tide phases or even on high barometric pressure where they're looking to equalize you can imagine this would be an area of structure that should get your attention and pay dividends on the right days okay"

                    description: "let's talk about this big highlighted area labeled grass Flats with potholes flats are probably what Anglers Target the most when looking for red fish and trout and that's because seagrass is the most plentiful cover in the region and holds tons of forage think of it as a grocery store the issue you have with a really big Zone like this is the gamefish could be anywhere in it so you have to Target the structure within the grass flat that is going to be primarily potholes of varying depths and sizes that gamefish utilize to Ambush prey but other structure within that flat could be Ambush points as well such as isolated micro shell bars Old prop scars I'm going to say even little Limestone Rocky shelves that are out there generally speaking you have to cover water in these types of structure zones to be Uber successful"
