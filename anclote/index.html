It carves out a nice deep hard flowing pass and it has hard sand bottom with a little rock pan. It's great for migrating fish every season of year and it's chock full of bait and anglers focus on this year-round."

This will have limiting appeal for a group of game fish that are looking for current to bring them feeding opportunities, but it still may provide an ambush chance for a single game fish or a lesser gamefish in physical size."

These deeper narrower flows are great ambush zones and are good plays, especially on tide changes. This type of structure is perfect for drawing in flounder, snook and speckled trout."

Often this type of structure is good on higher tide phases or a single gamefish will hunt for pulled up finger mullet or maybe just bask in the sun's warmth on a cold morning"

It's just an expansive static structure and it's home to lots of bottom dwelling crustaceans and vertebraes that redfish thrive on. It's really not cover because most prey can't hide there because they got to dig a hole."
